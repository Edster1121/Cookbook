<h1>Cookbook Project </h1>

<p> My project is a cookbook which keeps track of recipes for people for convenience. 
My recipe class will have  the following </p>
<ul>
  <li>recipe name</li>
  <li>author</li>
  <li>ingredients</li>
  <li>equipment</li>
  <li>steps required</li>
  <li>time required</li>
  <li>rating</li>
</ul>. 
<p> The cookbook class will be a list of recipes which people can look through to find the 
recipe they desire. </p>

People who cook at home are the main target audience. This will make it easier to store recipes and search for
them much easier than on paper (which can be lost or damaged beyond legibility). This project is of interest to me
as I **love** to cook at home and always wanted a better way to track my recipes. 

A *bulleted* list:
- As a user, I want to be able to store multiple recipes in a cookbook
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of recipes in my cookbook
- As a user, I want to be able to add recipes into my cookbook
- As a user, I want to rate the recipes on a scale of 1-5
- As a user, I want to be able to see a recipe in detail
- As a user, I want to be able to delete recipes from my cookbook
- As a user, I want to be able to edit recipes from my cookbook
