<h1>Cookbook Project </h1>

<p> My project is a cookbook which keeps track of recipes with steps, ingredients, equipment needed, and time required
to make the dish. It is The cookbook class will be a list of recipes which people can look through to find the 
recipe they desire. Each recipe will also be marked one of the following tags if applicable: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Vegetarian</li>
  <li>Vegan</li>
  <li>Gluten-Free</li>
  <li>Nut-Free</li>
</ul>. 
<p>This is to make this cookbook more accessible for people with certain dietary restrictions/preferences. 
</p>

People who cook at home are the main target audience. This will make it easier to store recipes and search for
them much easier than on paper (which can be lost or damaged beyond legibility). This project is of interest to me
as I **love** to cook at home and always wanted a better way to track my recipes. 

A *bulleted* list:
- As a user, I want to add recipes to my cookbook
- As a user, I want to rate the recipes on a scale of 1-5 on difficulty to make
- As a user, I want to be able to see a recipe in detail
- item 3
